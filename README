Thanks for trying out my client!

How to start it:
First you need to start your own private Tapestries proxy/Webserver.
Run StartProxy.bat which can be found in the "proxy"-folder
Done!

Next you open up your favorite Web browser. This should be Chrome (I haven't tried it on any other browser)

In the adress field, type:
http://localhost:8125

Now you can use it as any other client. Have fun!

Features:
* Capturing of commands such as look, wi, ws and wf, placing information in left and right panels
* Automatic updating of the list of furs in the room ('ws' list).
* If you want to update the Watchfor list, type 'wf'
* Chat history (CTRL+Up or CTRL+Down)
* Name Tab-completion. Instead of typing CthulhuSpwn,
  you can simply type Ct+Tab and it completes the name.
  The function uses the ws and wf list of names.
* Multiple connections on multiple browser tabs

New commands:
hide (Hides all text)
show (shows all text again)
show [name] (Kind of like "look [name]", but will only use stored character data. If you have once looked at someone, you can use show next time without the character)
reset (If the client goes haywire, spitting out wierd text, use this command to put things in order)

Just be aware that this is not even a Beta. It is Alpha.
Many features are missing and others are not completed.
But, it is still rather neat I think.

So, if you connect using the client, make sure to page/page #mail Neira (me!) and drop a comment.
