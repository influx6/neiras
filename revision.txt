Revision 3 (2012-03-22):
Added alert window when leaving the page

Revision 2 (2012-03-13):
Remade the Event code system so that it will automatic handle codes, storing them in the event.initCode and event.finishCode.
This will be activated if event.init() and/or event.finish() is set. These functions will be called on the arrival of the codes in the log.
Also, an Event Debug-mode has been added. It is activated/deactivated by the command 'debug' in the chat window.
The debug window will show all incoming text, very much like a pure Telnet-client, but grouped by how the Event system has handled the text.
Mouse-over the text will show what eventHandler has dealt with the line and what state the event is in currently.
